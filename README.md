BuzzBuz: An alternative public transporation tracker for the Georgia Institute of Technology

Current Problems in tracking:
- clunky + outdated UI
- difficulty navigating campus maps + routes
- complex view

Proposed Solution: 
- using Haversine formula to determine closest stops to both the user & destination accounting for Earth's curvature
- developing an algorithm to find a single or combination of bus stops to get to destination in the fastest amount of time -> blackbox the messy + complex map visual 
- designing a modern + easy-to-navigate interface

The goal is to create a "google-maps" type feature where users can input current and goal locations and be able to access multiple routes of varying times that meets their needs instead of having to scour the map itself
